# Space-Trivia-Game

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a space trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The game was styled with CSS. Enjoy testing your space knowledge!


### Requirements

I created a trivia form with multiple choice questions with one question per page. 

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

* The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* The player is not allowed to pick more than one answer per question.

* Include a countdown timer.
